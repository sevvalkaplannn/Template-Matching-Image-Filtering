# Template-Matching-Image-Filtering

In this project there are two parts.
In part 1 the mission is template matching by using four different similarity measures, they 
are Correlation Measure, Zero Mean Correlation Measure, Sum of Squared Difference 
Measure, and Normalized Cross Correlation Measure. According to minimum/maximum 
measure scores we are trying to perform template matching and draw a rectangle around 
the best match location. In part1a and part1b we are testing on two different input images.
In part 2 there are part2a and part2b. In part2a the mission is image filtering by using 
Butterworth Low Pass Filter and try it on four different pairs of (D0, n) values. In In part2b 
the mission is image filtering by using Butterworth High Pass Filter and try it on four 
different pairs of (D0, n) values.
